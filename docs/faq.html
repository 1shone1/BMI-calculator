            <div class="question">What is BMI?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                BMI (Body Mass Index) is a simple measurement using your weight and height to work out if your weight is healthy. The BMI calculation divides an adult's weight in kilograms by their height in meters squared.

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">How is BMI calculated?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                BMI is calculated using the formula: BMI = weight (kg) ÷ height² (m²). For example, if you weigh 70kg and are 1.75m tall, your BMI would be 70 ÷ (1.75 × 1.75) = 22.9.

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">What are the BMI categories?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                The standard BMI categories for adults are:<br>
                • Underweight: Below 18.5<br>
                • Normal weight: 18.5 to 24.9<br>
                • Overweight: 25 to 29.9<br>
                • Obese: 30 or greater

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Is BMI accurate for everyone?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                BMI is not a perfect measure as it doesn't account for factors like muscle mass, bone density, age, sex, ethnicity, and body composition. Athletes or muscular individuals might have a high BMI but not be overweight. It's best to use BMI as one of several indicators of health.

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">How often should I check my BMI?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                It's recommended to check your BMI whenever there are significant changes in your weight or every 6-12 months as part of your regular health check-up. However, rapid or frequent changes in BMI should be discussed with a healthcare provider.

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Can children use this BMI calculator?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                This calculator is designed for adults. Children and teens should use a specific BMI calculator that takes into account their age and gender, as their body composition changes significantly during development. Please consult a pediatrician for children's BMI assessment.
