# BMI Calculator – Project Overview

## Project Title
**BMI Calculator (Frontend Only)**

## Description
This is a simple web-based Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator that allows users to input their height and weight to calculate their BMI. It provides an instant result along with a health category (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese) based on the calculated value.

## Tech Stack
- **HTML** – For creating the structure of the calculator form.
- **CSS** – For styling the layout, input fields, and output display.

## Features
- Structured form with labeled input fields for height and weight
- Submit/reset buttons (currently non-functional)
- Styled layout with responsive design
- Placeholder or static result section

## How It Works
Since no JavaScript is used, the calculator is static. It serves as a front-end shell that can later be connected to backend logic or client-side scripting for full functionality.

## Future Enhancements
 Add JavaScript for actual BMI calculations
- Input validation
- Result categorization (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese)
- Add animations or transitions for better interactivity
